# Number-Converter

This converter is still limited in function.  
It is my first official practice project where I use GitHub to track progress.

## Progress Log

- **11/15** – Completed the binary/hex conversion.  
- **11/18** – Added 6 total options for conversion.  
  Currently validates that user input is between 1–6 before asking for conversion details.

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
