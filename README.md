# Number-Converter

Hello!
This converter is still limited in function.  
It is my first official practice project where I use GitHub to track progress.

## Progress Log

- **11/15** – Completed the binary/hex conversion.  
- **11/18** – Added 6 total options for conversion.  
  Currently validates that user input is between 1–6 before asking for conversion details.
- **11/19** - Completed option 1 functionality.
  Option 1 fully functional and clear of known errors.  Remaining options just terminate program for now.
- **11/20** - Option 2 functionality and clean up.
  Options 1 & 2 fully work now. The remaining options will just exit program.  
  Cleaned up code a bit with new functions (clear_screen())
- **11/22** - Added Hex to bin functionality.

## Future Plans

- Add remaining conversion functions.
- Complete functionality for remaining options.

## Compiling

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
