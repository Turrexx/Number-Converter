# Number-Converter

Hello!
This converter is still limited in function.  
It is my first official practice project where I use GitHub to track progress.

## Progress Log

- **11/15** – Completed the binary/hex conversion.  
- **11/18** – Added 6 total options for conversion.  
  Currently validates that user input is between 1–6 before asking for conversion details.
- **11/19** - Completed option 1 functionality.
  Option 1 fully functional and clear of known errors.  Remaining options just terminate program for now.

---
## Future Plans

- Add remaining conversion functions.
- Complete functionality for remaining options.

---

## Compiling

To compile the program:

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
